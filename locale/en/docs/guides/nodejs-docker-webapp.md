# Dockerizing a Node.js web app

The goal of this example is to show you how to get a Node.js application into a
Docker container. The guide is intended for development, and *not* for a
production deployment. The guide also assumes you have a working [Docker
installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and a basic
understanding of how a Node.js application is structured.

In the first part of this guide we will create a simple web application in
Node.js, then we will build a Docker image for that application, and lastly we
will run the image as a container.

Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a
standardized unit, called a container, for software development. A container is
a stripped-to-basics version of a Linux operating system. An image is software
you load into a container.

## Create the Node.js app

First, create a new directory where all the files would live. In this directory
create a `package.json` file that describes your app and its dependencies:

```json
{
  "name": "docker_web_app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js on Docker",
  "author": "First Last <first.last@example.com>",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.13.3"
  }
}
```

Then, create a `server.js` file that defines a web app using the
[Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) framework:

```javascript
'use strict';

const express = require('express');

// Constants
const PORT = 8080;
const HOST = '0.0.0.0';

// App
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world\n');
});

app.listen(PORT, HOST);
console.log(`Running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`);
```

In the next steps, we'll look at how you can run this app inside a Docker
container using the official Docker image. First, you'll need to build a Docker
image of your app.

## Creating a Dockerfile

Create an empty file called `Dockerfile`:

```markup
touch Dockerfile
```

Open the `Dockerfile` in your favorite text editor

The first thing we need to do is define from what image we want to build from.
Here we will use the latest LTS (long term support) version `boron` of `node`
available from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/):

```docker
FROM node:boron
```

Next we create a directory to hold the application code inside the image, this
will be the working directory for your application:

```docker
# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
```

This image comes with Node.js and NPM already installed so the next thing we
need to do is to install your app dependencies using the `npm` binary. Please
note that if you are using `npm` version 5 or later you will also want to copy
`package-lock.json`, which is generated once you run `npm install`:

```docker
# Install app dependencies
COPY package.json .
# For npm@5 or later, copy package-lock.json as well
# COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

RUN npm install
```

Note that, rather than copying the entire working directory, we are only copying
the `package.json` file. This allows us to take advantage of cached Docker
layers. bitJudo has a good explanation of this
[here](http://bitjudo.com/blog/2014/03/13/building-efficient-dockerfiles-node-dot-js/).

To bundle your app's source code inside the Docker image, use the `COPY`
instruction:

```docker
# Bundle app source
COPY . .
```

Your app binds to port `8080` so you'll use the `EXPOSE` instruction to have it
mapped by the `docker` daemon:

```docker
EXPOSE 8080
```

Last but not least, define the command to run your app using `CMD` which defines
your runtime. Here we will use the basic `npm start` which will run
`node server.js` to start your server:

```docker
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

Your `Dockerfile` should now look like this:

```docker
FROM node:boron

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
COPY package.json .
# For npm@5 or later, copy package-lock.json as well
# COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

RUN npm install

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

## .dockerignore file

Create a `.dockerignore` file in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`
with following content:

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
```

This will prevent your local modules and debug logs from being copied onto your
Docker image and possibly overwriting modules installed within your image.

## Building your image

Go to the directory that has your `Dockerfile` and run the following command to
build the Docker image. The `-t` flag lets you tag your image so it's easier to
find later using the `docker images` command:

```bash
$ docker build -t <your username>/node-web-app .
```

Your image will now be listed by Docker:

```bash
$ docker images

# Example
REPOSITORY                      TAG        ID              CREATED
node                            boron      539c0211cd76    3 weeks ago
<your username>/node-web-app    latest     d64d3505b0d2    1 minute ago
```

## Run the image

Running your image with `-d` runs the container in detached mode, leaving the
container running in the background. The `-p` flag redirects a public port to a
private port inside the container. Run the image you previously built:

```bash
$ docker run -p 49160:8080 -d <your username>/node-web-app
```

Print the output of your app:

```bash
# Get container ID
$ docker ps

# Print app output
$ docker logs <container id>

# Example
Running on http://localhost:8080
```

If you need to go inside the container you can use the `exec` command:

```bash
# Enter the container
$ docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash
```

## Test

To test your app, get the port of your app that Docker mapped:

```bash
$ docker ps

# Example
ID            IMAGE                                COMMAND    ...   PORTS
ecce33b30ebf  <your username>/node-web-app:latest  npm start  ...   49160->8080
```

In the example above, Docker mapped the `8080` port inside of the container to
the port `49160` on your machine.

Now you can call your app using `curl` (install if needed via: `sudo apt-get
install curl`):

```bash
$ curl -i localhost:49160

Hello world
```

We hope this tutorial helped you get up and running a simple Node.js application
on Docker.
